## Poster for the short film NOVA:

The project objective was to choose a famous director and to a brand. The director choosen was David Lynch and the brand was Band-Aid.

The idea of the short film is to focus about the wounds that cannot be healed and aware about it. Showing a part that Band-Aid couldn't heal.
