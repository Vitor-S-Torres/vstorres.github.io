## Abstract

> It is possible to notice the presence of many communities of fans of distinct midiatic works. Fans that, not only share information, create their own content regarding the content of their worship. This work is investigate three online communities regarding the Japanese animation Serial Experiments Lain. This research's main objective is to investigate the relation of three communities of fans from the Japanese animation Serial Experiments Lain establishes with the original work, in aesthetic and narrative terms. The questions this scientific initiation reaches to answer are: The fans, appropriate of websites and social networks to create their communities, or, when developing their own social network websites regarding their object of worship, they would be realizing transmidiatic narratives? In case of a positive answer, in what ways this communities expand, ressignify and/or resist the official narratives of their worship? For it the methodology utilized are the bibliographic research, in-depth research, audiovisual analysis and semiotics. The theoretical basis of this research grounds in authors that discuss fans, transmedia narratives, social networks, audiovisual narratives, semiotics.

## Example of an analysis:

Because of this media, it is possible to embed a scene to be played, so I decided to embed it for a better understanding of the breackdown that will be under it. Then a fan-made image will be shown to compare how did the fan appropriate from the original media and resignifies it.

- Analysis of the fan image:

The image, shows what came from a frame of of the original video. The retro elements, black lines and colour scheme, of the fan works brings the aesthetics of old meida especifically CRT. The media aestethics are vital to its fanbase because of how the narrative dialogues and plays a vital role.
