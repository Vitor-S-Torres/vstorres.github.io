Project made for the subject Creation III. It was to create a concept and develop it using various online medias. I choose the game "N1RV Ann-A" that is the sequel of the game "Va-11-Hall-A", both sets the players in a dystopic cyberpunk future as a bartender, in "N1RV Ann-A" the player will be a bartender of a luxury hotel. A presentation regarding it was made showing the concept and ideas:
