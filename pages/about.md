I am a GM, Game Master, for tabletop role-playing games for years, narrating and co-creating journeys with the players. Passionated cosplayer, being able to characterize myself as heroes and villains that I love and interacting as them is a fantastic experience. Starting to train Kendo, to better focus my body, spirit and mind.
